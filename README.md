Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio of work.

- The site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
- I included a link to a PDF of my resume (not current).
- I included a recent photo of myself.
- 
The information in the My Work section are samples of what I want to accomplish
- The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
- The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
- I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
